Cheating is not following the rules that are agreed upon by everybody during some sort of activity. I this case it 
is a test. Cheating on a test would mean copying someone elses work or using the internet to look up the answers.
It could also mean copying assignments from other people. Cheating would also be doing the test without the 
Jasmin's extension. Cheating would also mean copying the solutions to assignments if it was previously agreed upon
to only solve the problems you know how to solve yourself. If you talk to someone could also be conciderd cheating 
because it would break the no speaking during the exam rule.

If a person came forward and was punished for cheating it would not affect other people that have not cheated.
Even if the person that cheated didnt come forward the future exams would make them fail if they were not studying
to begin with. When you look at the bigger picture cheating in these kinds of learning enviorments is kind of useless
because you dont get any type of diploma and everytime you dont study or dont prepare you are losing valuable knowledge
without which you cant move forward as a developer.

Yes because it was not the whole groups fault because somebody didn't follow the rules. If the people in the group 
knew who cheated and kept it a secret than that could be concidered as something that should be punished. Monday-Friday 
classes are more convinient for everybody and they are creating a good habit of working daily on improving your skills
which is why I belive that everybody would prefer having only those classes but because there is a lot of students it 
would diminish the productivity of the class. It is a lot better for teachers to teach smaller groups because they can 
explain any questions more in depth to students if there is less questions. That also might also be a reason  why we 
might not be able to join the monday-friday class.
