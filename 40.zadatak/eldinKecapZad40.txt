1. Why can a const change value in this example ?

var obj = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3};

for (const prop in obj) {
  console.log(`obj.${prop} = ${obj[prop]}`);
}

2. What happens if we make an infinite loop in the JavaScript engine ?
3. Can we use for in and for of loops inside eachother ?
4. Why do we have 5 loops if a basic for loop can do it all, is there a performance difference ?
5. Can labels be used with other flow control keywords ?
