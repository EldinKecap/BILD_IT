        My name is Eldin Kecap. I have experience with HTML,CSS,JavaScript and C++. 
    <br>I have experience with working in teams on projects because I worked on 3 skateboarding related projects
    <br>that included manging a team of people, managing activities, managing our budget and other administration related activities.
    <br>I have built multiple static websites as part of online courses I was taking. One of my strenghts is that I am speak English fluently.
    <br>I am currently studying at IPI academy and looking for ways to expand my knowledge. I am always ready to learn new technologies and adapt to the company enviorment. 
    <br>One important life lesson I carry with me every day is that I will never give up because that is the only way you can fail when you are trying to do something.
    <br>I love being surrounded buy people that all have the same goal in mind and helping them reach it. I hope you accept my job application and we see eachother soon.
