1. In the world of software, what is a tool?
A tool is everything that helps you create ,test ,deploy solutions and makes your life as a developer easier and more productive. Examples of tools are
(editors/IDE, file sharing websites, version control system, linux, communication channels for teams, continous integration, project
management software, frameworks,package managers,web design tools like adobe Dreamweaver, Photo editors ). 

In the world of software, what is not a tool?
When choosing a tool we have to take into consideration it's usefulness because there is no perfect tool for 
every situation. You cant cut paper with a hammer. You dont use web deployment software for a desktop app.
If you work alone you dont need a communication channel but you might make use of a project management software.
I would also like to say that in the content I have read search engines, tutorials etc...
are not mentioned as tools even though I feel like they are at least learning tools if nothing else. Also most video games are not tools but
we did play some while learning. I guess content like images, videos etc... are not tools because they are 
something like material we use to create goodlooking websites.
