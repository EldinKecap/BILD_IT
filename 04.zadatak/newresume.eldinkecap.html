       Experience
    </h2>
    <p>
        I have experience with working in teams on projects because I worked on 3 skateboarding related projects<br> 
that included manging a team of people, managing activities, managing our budget and other administration related activities.<br> 
I have built multiple static websites as part of online courses I was taking. One of my strenghts is that I am speak English fluently.<br> 
I am currently studying at IPI academy and looking for ways to expand my knowledge. I am always ready to learn new technologies and adapt to the company enviorment.<br> 
One important life lesson I carry with me every day is that I will never give up because that is the only way you can fail when you are trying to do something.<br> 
I love being surrounded by people that all have the same goal in mind and helping them reach it. I hope you accept my job application and we see eachother soon.<br>
