Well the first difference between a horse and a wagon is that the horse has a long face. Second one would be that wagon has wheels instead of legs.
Horses are used to pull wagons and give them purpose because without the horse a wagon would just be a bunch of nicely carved wood. Now lets talk a little bit
about Zebras. Zebra in my country is one of the names we gave our crosswalks because of the stripes of course. In my opinion zebras are just smaller horses that went to jail and
somehow managed to escape. Furthermore I think horses are one of the main reasons human society could evolve our economy in such a short time. I guess we could be even more advanced
if the zebras helped out. I have never seen a zebra pull a wagon before so maybe the differene between them and horses is that horses are just honest workers.
So to keep this short story short I just want to say that no matter how different a wagon,zebra and a horse are, if they work together they can help humans
build communities and their stables.
