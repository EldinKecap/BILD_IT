1. Does this alter the constructor or does it leave the variable undefined?
let user = {
  name,  // same as name:name
  age: 30
};
2. if it is a string why is the plus added in the alert ?
let codes = {
  "+49": "Germany",
  "+41": "Switzerland",
  "+44": "Great Britain",
  // ..,
  "+1": "USA"
};

for (let code in codes) {
  alert( +code ); // 49, 41, 44, 1
}
3. If you create an object using a constructor and then override the constructor to add new atributes,
will it use the last known declaration as with other functions ?
4.Is prototype used only to add other methods and properties to the objects ?
5.What is a query in document.querySelector ?
