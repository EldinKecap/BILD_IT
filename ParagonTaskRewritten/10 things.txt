1. I was talking to my friend about, a project I was working on and he just said it was easy in a stuck up way.
2. I was talking to my friend and he mentioned he was watching soccer, I said why (as in why would you watch that)
just because i didnt like soccer.
3. My friend created a logo for our association and it looked bad, so i said he could make a better one because this
one isn't his best work. He took that personally and started talking about how everything he does is not good enough
and he started raising his voice. The reality of the situation is that he was lazy to make another one.
