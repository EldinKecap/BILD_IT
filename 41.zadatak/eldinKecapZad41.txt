I like that we got to do some tasks after the lecture. The linux hint website has a bunch of ads that 
makes it look unprofessional. I also like the iclusion of flow diagrams on the Guru99 page. 
1. What does prompt return if the user cancels the input? 
2. Can labels only be used with loops ?
3. Is regular for loop better than for of and for in loops ?
